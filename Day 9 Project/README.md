Project Overview :

This project is a Memory Management System that uses linked lists to handle memory allocation and deallocation efficiently. It serves as a simulation of how an operating system might manage memory, helping users understand linked list-based memory handling concepts.


Features:

1. Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
2. Visualization of memory blocks as a linked list.
3. Fragmentation management.
4. Example-based explanations for educational purposes.


Requirements :

1. Programming Language: C / C++ (mention the language you used)
2. Compiler: GCC or any other C/C++ compiler
3. Operating System: Linux, Windows, or macOS


Installation :

1. git clone https://github.com/ashukumari95/memory-management-using-linked-list.
2. git cd memory-management-using-linked-list
3. gcc memory_management.c -o memory_management
4.  ./memory_management


Usage :

Run the program and input the required parameters for memory allocation/deallocation. The system will show how memory blocks are managed using a linked list.


Code Structure :

1. memory_management.c: Contains the core logic for memory management using linked lists.
2. README.md: This file, containing documentation.
3. LICENSE: The license for this project.
